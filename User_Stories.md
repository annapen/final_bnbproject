# Final Project Overview: Code MD201-4

## Bites'N Bethesda 

### User Stories

Maslow's Hierachy of Needs lists **food** as one of the basic physiological necessities of life. When the call of nature beckons and hunger strikes, no one wants to be faced with the undaunting task of figuring out _where to eat_. Working through the logistics of satisfying one's hunger is difficult. As modern day _Hunter Gatherers_ this can be further complicated when you have various palettes to satisfy; i.e. a **family, or a large group of friends**.

This is where Bites'N Bethesda comes in... let's be honest; sometimes deciding where to eat can be hard. We won't promise to eliminate all the uncertainties, but our solutions are designed to make your _"Hunt"_ a little bit simplier.

**Bites'n Bethesda** provides nutritious and delectable dining options in the Bethesda area; we allow our users to search our database by providing key _"cuisine options"_ (i.e. Italian, Asian, Spanish, and French) to fine-tune your dining experience. To top it off, we will even throw in **recommended parking location(s)** for your selected dining selection... because, yeah in Bethesda, that's important too!!

## Problem Domain

To create this _"dine-out selection"_ application we enlisted a team of talented development experts. The project stakeholders are as follows:

- `Market researchers`: researches were engaged to conduct market analysis on restaurants within the Bethesda area. Their findings would then highlight **sixteen (16) marquee restaurants** in Bethesda; the names of which would be submitted to our development team. _N.B. The analysis is re-initiated every month to provide an updated database for the application_.

- `Videographers/Photographers`: a team of _visionaires_ visited all sixteen locations to shoot eye-catching images of the restaurants.

- `UX/UI Designers`: a team of designers _wireframed_ the layout and user experience components of the project.

- `Developers`: a development team was tasked with the challenge of bringing **Bites'N Bethesda** to life. They are the _brains_ behind the `technical requirements` and innovations of the application.

## Technical Requirements:

`UX/UI Designers` generated wireframmed sketches and details which guided the development team's formulation of `technical requirements` for the project (_see attached sketches and notes in the project assets folder_).

The application consists of **four (4)** HTML pages with accompanying CSS and JavaScript code to style and drive the interactivity of the application. A master repository `final_bnbproject` was created with accompanying branches: `html-content`; `css-content`; `js-content`. _User Stories_ was housed on the master branch.

The **four** primary HTML pages were as follows: `index.html` `contact.html` `select.html` and `results.html`. Each HTML page was styled by its respective CSS page: `main.css` `contact.css` `select.css` and `results.css`. The entire project was driven by the JavaScript code created in a `select.js` and subsequent `results.js` file.

The application launches on a main page `index.html`. It includes an `About us` section and a *tag-line*. A link is established to the **selection page** `select.html` titled `LETS BEGIN`. There are also established links in the `navbar` to the `select.html` and `contact.html` page. 

The selection page utilizes a `div` with radio selections of **four cuisine options**. The users selection invokes the display of **four restaurant logos** that are directly correlated to the selected cuisine category. This was facilitated with an `eventListener` with initiates `on click`; pulls from an array and displays the *four (4) corresponding restaurant logo* **images** (_determined by the user's previously clicked cuisine selection_) on the `select.html` page. The logos are display in a div called `imageContainer`; referenced and subsequently manipulated in the DOM using the `getElementById` method. 

A subsequent user selection of any one of the four restaurant logo options will displays the restaurant image on the `result.html` page. This entire functionality is powered by the `select.js` file which utilizes **arrays, DOM manipulation, function declarations, For-Of loops, protoyping**, and **local storage** to drive the projects interactivity.

An embedded *video banner* is displayed on the `select.html` using the `video` tag to give the user an *drivethrough* of the Bethesda area. The Video is _loaded and ran automatically_ *on loop* when the select page is initiated. The user will not have **access to the video controls** and the video is displaced the instant the user selects a **Cuisine Option**.

On the `results.html` page the JavaScript code `results.js` manipulates the DOM (_pulling the previously_ **stored logo selection** _from local storage and aligning it to it's associated_ **restaurant image**). The implied DOM manipulation displays the name and image of the **user's selected restaurant**. Finally, the application will reference the *nearest parking location(s)*. A `link` titled "Available Parking" will show a preview snippet from **Google Maps** `on hover` (_whenever the user hovers the mouse pointer over the coded area_).

## Project Timeline

- **Tuessday, April 2nd**: Initial HTML + CSS Demo to be submited for review and assessment

- **Wednesda, April 3rd**: JavaScript included to project and demo conducted for review and assessment

- **Thursday, April 4th**: Beta test for project

- **Saturday, April 6th**: Full demo for final project with presentation elements.

N.B. To `reload` or return the application to the homepage click on the company logo or `HOME` link referenced in the NAV-BAR (_This is accessible on all four pages_). **The assets folder houses all restaurant images, logos and the video relevant to the project.**

* Update - April 4, 2019: A navbar was included to each page and a `contact.html` page will be added to the project. The team is exploring the possibility of including a clever _easter egg_; details will be provided in future updates to the _User Stories_ file.

* Update - April 8, 2019: _Easter egg_ inclusion was abandoned. Contact page completed and effectively linked into project.

* Update - April 10, 2019: _Video file_ `bethview_trim.mp4` will be loaded locally due to Github restrictions.
